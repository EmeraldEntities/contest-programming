# contest-programming

this is just a collection of all stuff that i do for practice or something

I dunno if you can really learn from any of this since my coding may be a bit wack?

## todo
- learn how to do c++ cause that's what cool kids use
- get my first 15 point dmoj problem
- get my first 20 point dmoj problem

yeah it's a short todo but at least i have goals now

## gamer problems
- [Waterpark (CCC '07 S4)] (https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc07s4) - Was pretty fun to figure out, DP + graph theory, try it out ;)
- [Geneva Confection (CCC '14 S3)] (https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc14s3) - Nice stack practice problem

### extemely gamer problems
- [Python infinite loop] (https://dmoj.ca/problem/shortest1) - this one is great
